# Hi there! Welcome to this very special page of mine.

- ‚úàÔ∏è I‚Äôm currently working on a a multitude of aviation-related navigation utilities and APIs.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently exploring Amazon AWS, React/Next.JS and React Native.

## My story
My name is Malte and I am a 20-year-old self-taught web developer. I made my first site using HTML and CSS at the age of 12, and since then I have been determined to build out every idea I could possibly think of. Now, several years and personal projects later, I've expanded my knowledge by incrementally exploring technologies like Web Components all the way to popular frameworks sucha as React, React Native and Angular. Additionally, I have become comfortble enough with the AWS infrastructure and backend frameworks like Express and NestJS to deploy full-stack applications without much hesitation. I've also become a huge fan of TypeScript, and throughout all my projects you will find that my commits keep to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard!

## My values
To me, personal development is just as important as teamwork. I love sharing my knowledge with others, as it scratches all the right spots - most importantly contribution to my community and self-growth. As a developer, I strive to create accessible, functional and responsive experiences for the user while producing readable, structured and meaningful code.
