## Hi there! Welcome to my ✨ special ✨ profile! 
I am an enthusiastic, motivated and competent problem-solver with an optimistic view on new challenges. Personal development is just as important as teamwork, and I learn the most when sharing my knowledge with others. As a developer, I strive to create modern, functional and responsive experiences for the user while producing creative, structured and meaningful code.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a web portal for time reports
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Svelte and Web Components
- 🎓 I'm currently taking a Full Stack Developer course at [Chas Academy](https://chasacademy.se/)
